        "This project aims to build an effective machine learning model to detect hate speech and offensive language in tweets. The primary focus is to differentiate between hate speech, offensive language, and neutral content by leveraging transformer models, specifically HateBERT, which is designed for abusive and hate speech detection. Given the challenges posed by the class imbalance in the dataset, various techniques, including data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and Explainable AI (XAI) methods, will be applied to improve model performance and interpretability. Hate speech being in itself blurry by definition, this is a relevant space of research that poses challenges, with XAI applications being very relevant in offering more insight into a model's reaosning, allowing for future investigations into bias etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "This document contains the process towards reaching a final overall accuracy of 92%, which is adequate. It documents in detail the testing of 6 models, including a baseline model, BERT and HateBERT models, as well as refers to any extra hyperparameter tuning efforts that were conducted, but left out to not overly crowd an already-large document.\n",

        "Total tweets: 24,783\n",
        "Classes:\n",
        "- Offensive Language: 19,190 tweets (Class 1)\n",
        "- Neutral Language: 4,163 tweets (Class 2)\n",
        "- Hate Speech: 1,430 tweets (Class 0)\n",
        "\n",
        "Source: The dataset was sourced from an openly available collection of tweets labeled for hate speech detection. It has been widely used for research in the fields of abusive language detection and sentiment analysis. You can find the dataset here: https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language/tree/master\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset has the following columns:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tweet: the original text tweet\n",
        "- Class: the label corresponding to the type of language in the tweet\n",
        "- Count, hate_speech_offensive_language, neither: columns not directly used for model training but providing background information\n",
        "\n",
        "The class distribution is imbalanced, with less hate speech tweets than others, which will be the basis of the principle challenge, which is that models find it hard to detect hate speech over offensive language.\n"

        "The word cloud shows that offensive language contains many profanities and slurs. These common words may dominate the classification task, making it necessary to balance the focus on all word features, possibly using regularisation techniques in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The distribution of tweet lengths suggests that most tweets are between 10 and 20 words long. This will guide our choice of maximum sequence length for padding the input data. Setting the padding length around 30-40 words should cover the majority of tweets without excessive truncation.\n",

        "The word cloud reveals that certain words (e.g., \"hoe\", \"bitch\", \"trash\") are heavily represented in offensive language. Understanding these word patterns will be useful when analyzing misclassifications later and may help when interpreting the attention mechanisms."
